Module: Data.Act

An "Act" of a semigroup \( S \) on a type \( X \) gives a way to transform terms of type \( X \) by terms of type \( S \),
in a way that is compatible with the semigroup operation on \( S \).

In the special case that there is a unique way of going from one term of type \( X \) to another
through a transformation by a term of type \( S \), we say that \( X \) is a torsor under \( S \).

For example, the plane has an action by translations. Given any two points, there is a unique translation
that takes the first point to the second. Note that an unmarked plane (like a blank piece of paper)
has no designated origin or reference point, whereas the set of translations is a plane with a given origin
(the zero translation). This is the distinction between an affine space (an unmarked plane) and a vector space.
Enforcing this distinction in the types can help to avoid confusing absolute points with translation vectors.


Simple 'Act' and 'Torsor' instances can be derived through self-actions:

> > newtype Seconds   = Seconds { getSeconds :: Double }
> >   deriving ( Act TimeDelta, Torsor TimeDelta )
> >     via TimeDelta
> > newtype TimeDelta = TimeDelta { timeDeltaInSeconds :: Seconds }
> >   deriving ( Semigroup, Monoid, Group )
> >     via Sum Double
